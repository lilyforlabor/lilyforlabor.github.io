As a woman of immigrant background who has dedicated a significant part of my life to social justice, I believe it is high time to bring about tangible change to the policies that shape our society. That is why I am putting myself forward as a delegate to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) National Conference.

My journey to this point has been filled with inspiring narratives and hard-learned lessons from my work as an interpreter within diverse migrant communities. This enriching experience has gifted me with a deep understanding of the unique challenges and aspirations of immigrants. It has shown me the immense value of cultural diversity, the spirit of resilience, and the universal longing for a safe and prosperous life. The strength and determination of the people I have met in my line of work have profoundly shaped my vision for a more inclusive, just, and equitable Australia.

As the ALP is deeply committed to immigration reform - recognising it as a crucial cornerstone for a thriving, diverse nation - I am keen to contribute my insights to this vital conversation. I stand firmly in the belief that our party's policies should reflect the lived experiences and perspectives of our diverse membership, and I am ready to be the conduit for those voices. 

I am running to represent you, and all of us who believe in the power of diversity and social justice, at the ALP National Conference. I want to ensure that our collective experiences and insights drive the policies that will shape our nation's future. I want to help the Labor Party remain a progressive force that champions the rights of immigrants and all those striving for a better life in Australia.

My commitment is to listen, understand, and represent your thoughts and concerns at the Conference. I want to drive policies that resonate with our shared beliefs, that address the complexities of immigration, and that continue to build on our country's rich multicultural fabric. 

We are at a pivotal juncture where we have the opportunity to shape the narrative around immigration. The dialogues we foster, the policies we draft, and the actions we take can significantly impact the lives of thousands. This is a responsibility I do not take lightly. 

I am aware that the task ahead is demanding, but I am ready to rise to the occasion. With my deep understanding of migrant communities, my commitment to social justice, and my unwavering belief in the power of diverse voices, I am prepared to take on this challenge. 

As an interpreter, I was fortunate to serve as a bridge between cultures, helping individuals navigate through unfamiliar territories. Now, I am eager to take a step further and contribute towards shaping the policies that govern these territories. 

I humbly ask for your support and your vote. Let us together create a narrative that is inclusive, compassionate, and reflective of our shared values. Let us shape a future where everyone is valued, where diversity is celebrated, and where social justice isn't just an aspiration but a tangible reality. 

Your vote will not just be a vote for me, but a vote for a vision of an inclusive and equitable Australia. Thank you for your trust and support. Together, we can create a more compassionate and understanding society for all.
